This states assumptions and conventions of this projects

bounds are in the form bounds (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)

Image arrays always have 3 dimensions. E.g. (height, width, 1) for images with only one channel

 x,y or lon,lat order is always used for coordinates never y,x or lat,lon

Whenever applicable expected behavior and format should be similar to corresponding features of other common geospatial packages and libraries
