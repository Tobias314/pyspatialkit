This states assumptions and conventions of this projects

bounds are in the form bounds (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)

images are indexed with [row, col, num_channels] with 0,0 at top left corner (matrix notation)

Image arrays always have 3 dimensions. E.g. (height, width, 1) for images with only one channel

 x,y or lon,lat order is always used for coordinates never y,x or lat,lon

 Point clouds xyz is an array like type of shape (n,3)

Whenever applicable expected behavior and format should be similar to corresponding features of other common geospatial packages and libraries

Docstrings are written using Google format (https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)

For 3d data the third axes (axes at index 2 when zero indexing) / z axis is the up/height axis

Point density is given as the distance between points
